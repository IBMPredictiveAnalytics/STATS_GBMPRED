<h1>STATS GBMPRED Extension Command</h1>

<p>Make predictions for new data from a model estimated by the STATS GBM
extension command.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p>STATS GBMPRED MODELFILE=&ldquo;<em>filespec</em>&rdquo;
ID=<em>varname</em></p>

<p>/SAVE DATASET=<em>dataset</em><sup>&#42;</sup> INCLUDEIND = YES<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> or NO</p>

<p>/OPTIONS BESTTREES=YES or NO NTREES=<em>integer or list of integers</em>

<p>STATS GBMPRED /HELP displays this text and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>STATS GBMPRED 
/SAVE DATASET=pred INCLUDEIND=YES
/OPTIONS BESTTREES=YES PREDSCALE=LINK.
</code></pre>

<p>All of the predictors from the original model must appear in the
dataset on which predictions will be made.  Missing values in
the predictors will be treated the same way as they were in
the estimation process.</p>

<p><strong>MODELFILE</strong> specifies to use the model from a file saved by
STATS GBM.  If it is not specified, the estimation results are
taken from the currently loaded R workspace.</p>

<p>The command output is a new dataset.  <strong>ID</strong> optionally specifies an
ID variable to facilitate merging this with the input data.</p>

<h2>SAVE</h2>

<p><strong>DATASET</strong> specifies a name for the predicted values dataset.  The dataset
name must not already be in use.  The dataset variables will be
the ID variable, if specified,
the predicted values, and
the independent variables if INCLUDEIND = YES.</p>

<p>The number of trees used for the predictions is controlled by
<strong>BESTTREES</strong> and <strong>NTREES</strong>.  If a best trees value was computed, it can
be used by specifying BESTTREES=YES.  Otherwise, NTREES specifies
the number of trees or a list of numbers of trees to use.  If both
BESTTREES and NTREES are specified, the besttrees value is prepended
to the NTREES list.  If neither is specified, the number of trees
specified at estimation time is used.</p>

<p>There will be one variable in the output dataset for each number of trees
specified.  If the dependent variable in the model is named
Y, the prediction variables will have names like Y&#95;110, Y&#95;500,&hellip;
where the suffix is the number of trees used for that set of predictions.</p>

<p><strong>PREDSCALE</strong> specifies what is being predicted.  If the model has the
form Y= f(x), LINK creates predictions for f(x), i. e., the link
function.  For Bernoulli it calculates the log odds; for Poisson,
the log of counts, and for coxph, the log hazard.</p>

<p>If <strong>RESPONSE</strong> is specified, predictions are converted
to the outcome scale.  This only affects  Bernoulli and Poisson.</p>
